# kaggle-competitions

In this repoistory I put Notebooks that I used for some Kaggle competitions.

I am keeping these for myself in case I need to remember how to use some
ML tools. 
I will also include links to useful resources that I used while working on
competitions.

I won't include any datasets here - those are available on Kaggle.
